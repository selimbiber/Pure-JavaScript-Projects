![Design preview for the Social media dashboard with theme switcher coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this Social Media Dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle color theme to their preference

## My Description

- This project was my second project that I completed using webpack technology and Javascript module system.
- With this project, I now feel more confident in using webpack technology and Javascript module system in my projects.
- Thanks to this project, I worked for the first time on the feature of changing the color theme of the page according to user preference.
