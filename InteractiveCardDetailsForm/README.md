# Frontend Mentor - Interactive card details form

## Welcome! üëã

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this Interactive card details form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to: 

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time 
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if: 
  - Any input field is empty 
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format 
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size 
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

## Expected behaviour 

- Update the details on the card as the user fills in the fields 
- Validate the form fields when the form is submitted 
- If there are no errors, display the completed state 
- Reset the form when the user clicks "Continue" on the completed state 

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT ‚ö†Ô∏è: When you create the live version of your project, we recommmend giving it a random name for the URL. This is because with it being a fake credit card form, some browsers will open a warning notice before people can access your project. So it's best to name the project something unrelated to credit cards so that browsers don't show the warning to people viewing your project.**
