# [Restaurant Page | The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

## Description

I used Webpack technology for the first time while doing this project, which belongs to The Odin Project training curriculum.
The novice process that can be experienced when using a technology for the first time was a bit difficult for me, but I think I improved myself a little more at the end of this project.
But I couldn't focus enough on the visual design of the project.
